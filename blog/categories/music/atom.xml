<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="Education, Education, Education & War" src="http://NatalieBlack.github.io/images/albums/education_education_education_and_war.jpg" ></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education,_Education,_Education_%26_War">Education, Education, Education & War</a> by Kaiser Chiefs</p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Hey, it's more of this thing I like</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>I got a lot more into Kaiser Chiefs in general shortly before this album came out.  This is one of the few albums on this list that I didn't/won't get to experience live and that's a shame.</p>
</div>




<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="Hang on to Each Other EP" src="http://NatalieBlack.github.io/images/albums/hang_on_to_each_other.jpg" ></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_On_to_Each_Other">Hang On to Each Other</a> by Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>The only appropriate reaction to a collaboration between TSMZMO and Ariel Engle is excitement.</p>
</div>




<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="Heights" src="http://NatalieBlack.github.io/images/albums/heights.jpg" ></p>
<p>Heights by <a href="http://www.thebeachesband.com/">The Beaches</a></p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Exceeded expectations</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Track: </strong>Little Pieces</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>Despite The Beaches playing at more than one festival I attended this year, I was unaware of them until I saw they were going to be one of the opening acts at the Mother Mother show I went to last month.  I never have high expectations from opening acts but after checking out this EP I found myself really looking forward to their set.  Whether live or recorded, this band doesn't disappoint!</p>
</div>




<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="In Conflict" src="http://NatalieBlack.github.io/images/albums/in_conflict.jpg" ></p>

<p><strong>Rating: </strong>♥ Expectations exceeded; I couldn't stop listening to it</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Track: </strong>Let Me Be Mine</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>I've never been a devout Spoon fan before, so I was surprised by how much I loved this album.</p>
</div>

<p>City Wrecker EP by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Krug">Moonface</a></p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Hey, it's more of this thing I love</p> 
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>I was pretty excited about this release based on how obsessed I was/am with Moonface's previous album.  I wouldn't say I love City Wrecker as much as Julia With Blue Jeans On, but that would have been a feat.  This is still great and haunting music.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeds_%28TV_on_the_Radio_album%29">Seeds</a> by TV on the Radio</p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Hey, it's more of this thing I like</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>I put off listening to this album until this week because I was worried it would make me regret not going to the show TV on the Radio played here last month.  I supposed it's both good and bad news that finally listening to it didn't make me feel that way, but I also feel like I'm still just getting to know the album.</p>
</div>


<p>Here are some other albums that I discovered and subsequently listened to a lot in the last year, despite them having existed for longer that that:</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Coding Freedom and the Cruel Contradiction of Creative Collaboration]]></title>
    <link href="http://NatalieBlack.github.io/blog/2014/08/09/cruel-contradiction/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-09T15:37:48-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://NatalieBlack.github.io/blog/2014/08/09/cruel-contradiction</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago I finished reading the highly intelligent <i>Coding Freedom</i> by E. Gabriella Coleman.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Although much of historical content might be a review for readers who are already familiar with the free and open software movements, the book is full of refreshing insights, the variety that is best provided by subcultural outsiders.  I always appreciate things that put programming into context with other creative and social pursuits.</p>

<p>Here is one of my favourite passages:</p>

<blockquote><p>Over time, this [version control] record accumulates into a richly documented palimpsest.  Though individual attribution is certainly accorded, these technological palimpsests reflect unmistakably that complicated pieces of software are held in place by a grand collaborative effort that far exceeds any one person&rsquo;s contribution.
In contrast to many accounts on authorship, I find that a short description about the aesthetics of jazz and its &ldquo;cruel contradiction&rdquo; is eerily evocative of the hacker creative predicament:</p>

<blockquote><p>There is a cruel contradiction implicit in the art form itself.  For true jazz is an art of individual assertion within and against the group.  Each true jazz moment (as distinct from the uninspired commercial performance) springs from a context in which each artist challenges all the rest, each solo flight, or improvisation, represents (like the successive canvases of a painter) a definition of his identity: as individual, as member of the collectivity, and as link in the chain of tradition.  Thus, because jazz finds its very life in an endless improvisation upon traditional materials, the jazzman must lose his identity even as he finds it.  (Ellison 1964, 234; quoted in Gilroy 1993, 79)
Among hackers this cruelty, this difficulty in establishing discrete originality, is in reality not so cruel.  It is treated like any interesting problem: an enticing hurdle that invites rigorous intellectual intervention and a well-crafted solution within given constraints.  Hackers clearly define the meaning of the free individual through this very persistent inclination to find solutions; they revel in directing their faculty for critical thought toward creating better technology or more sublime, beautiful code.  The logic among hackers goes that if one can create beauty, originality, or solve a problem within the shackles of constraints, this must prove a <em>superior</em> form of creativity, intelligence, and individuality than the mere expression of some wholly original work.
Not every piece of technology made by hackers qualifies as a hack.  The hack is particularly the &ldquo;individual assertion within and against the group&rdquo; (Ellison 1964, 234), which may be easily attached to an individual even though it is still indebted to a wider tradition and conversation.  Hackers certainly engage in a creative, complex process partially separated from hierarchy, enfolding a mechanics of dissection, manipulation, and reassembly, in which various forms of collaboration are held in high esteem.  Much of their labor is oriented toward finding a good enough solution so they can carry forth with their work.  But their form of production is one that also generates a practice of cordial (and sometimes not-so-cordial) one-upping, which simultaneously acknowledges the hacker&rsquo;s technical roots and yet at times strives to go beyond inherited forms in order to implement a better solution.  If this solution is achieved, it will favorably reveal one&rsquo;s capacity for original, critical thought &ndash; the core meaning of individuality among hackers.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

As the world&rsquo;s foremost* Tegan and Sara/code crossover enthusiast I feel that it is my duty to enumerate these repositories and give them each a nod of approval.</p>
