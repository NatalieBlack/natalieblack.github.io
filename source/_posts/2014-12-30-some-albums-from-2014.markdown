<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck_Off_Get_Free_We_Pour_Light_on_Everything">Fuck Off Get Free We Pour Light on Everything</a> by Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Track: </strong>What We Loved Was Not Enough</p>
</div>

<div class="album">
<p><img class="album_img" alt="Darlings" src="/images/albums/darlings.jpg" ></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlings_%28Kevin_Drew_album%29">Darlings</a> by Kevin Drew</p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Good</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Track: </strong>First in Line</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>I get excited when my favourite coffee shop plays this.</p>
</div>

<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="Education, Education, Education & War" src="/images/albums/education_education_education_and_war.jpg" ></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education,_Education,_Education_%26_War">Education, Education, Education & War</a> by Kaiser Chiefs</p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Hey, it's more of this thing I like</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>I got a lot more into Kaiser Chiefs in general shortly before this album came out.  This is one of the few albums on this list that I didn't/won't get to experience live and that's a shame.</p>
</div>

<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="Hang on to Each Other EP" src="/images/albums/hang_on_to_each_other.jpg" ></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_On_to_Each_Other">Hang On to Each Other</a> by Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>The only appropriate reaction to a collaboration between TSMZMO and Ariel Engle is excitement.</p>
</div>

<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="Heights" src="/images/albums/heights.jpg" ></p>
<p>Heights by <a href="http://www.thebeachesband.com/">The Beaches</a></p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Exceeded expectations</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Track: </strong>Little Pieces</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>Despite The Beaches playing at more than one festival I attended this year, I was unaware of them until I saw they were going to be one of the opening acts at the Mother Mother show I went to last month.  I never have high expectations from opening acts but after checking out this EP I found myself really looking forward to their set.  Whether live or recorded, this band doesn't disappoint!</p>

<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="In Conflict" src="/images/albums/in_conflict.jpg" ></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Conflict">In Conflict</a> by Owen Pallett</p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>♥ I couldn't stop listening to it</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Tracks: </strong>On a Path, Song for Five & Six</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>If I was forced to pick a favourite from the year this might be it.</p>
</div>

<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="Music For Heart and Breath" src="/images/albums/music_for_heart_and_breath.jpg">
<p>Music for Heart and Breath by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Reed_Parry">Richard Reed Parry</a></p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Super cool and even more so when it's live</p>
</div>
<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="They Want My Soul" src="/images/albums/they_want_my_soul.jpg" ></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Want_My_Soul">They Want My Soul</a> by Spoon</p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>♥ Expectations exceeded; I couldn't stop listening to it</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Track: </strong>Let Me Be Mine</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>I've never been a devout Spoon fan before, so I was surprised by how much I loved this album.</p>
</div>
<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="El Pintor" src="/images/albums/el_pintor.jpg" ></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pintor_%28album%29">El Pintor</a> by Interpol</p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>A bit hit or miss</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Track: </strong>Ancient Ways, Tidal Wave</p>
</div>
<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="City Wrecker" src="/images/albums/city_wrecker.jpg" ></p>
<p>City Wrecker EP by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Krug">Moonface</a></p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Hey, it's more of this thing I love</p> 
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>I was pretty excited about this release based on how obsessed I was/am with Moonface's previous album.  I wouldn't say I love City Wrecker as much as Julia With Blue Jeans On, but that would have been a feat.  This is still great and haunting music.</p>
</div>

<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="We Loved Her Dearly" src="/images/albums/we_loved_her_dearly.jpg" ></p>
<p>We Loved Her Dearly by <a href="http://www.oncloud69.com/">Lowell</a></p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>A bit hit or miss</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Track: </strong>Cloud 69</p>
</div>

<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="Very Good Bad Thing" src="/images/albums/very_good_bad_thing.jpg" ></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Good_Bad_Thing">Very Good Bad Thing</a> by Mother Mother</p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Not bad, but disappointing</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Track: </strong>Get Out the Way</p>
</div>

<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="Bury Me at Makeout Creek" src="/images/albums/bury_me_at_makeout_creek.jpg" ></p>

<p><strong>Rating: </strong>♥ I still can't stop listening to it</p>
<p><strong>Favourite Track: </strong>I Don't Smoke</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>This is my current favourite thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="album"><p><img class="album_img" alt="Seeds" src="/images/albums/seeds.jpg" ></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeds_%28TV_on_the_Radio_album%29">Seeds</a> by TV on the Radio</p>
<p><strong>Rating: </strong>Hey, it's more of this thing I like</p>
<p><strong>Comments: </strong>I put off listening to this album until this week because I was worried it would make me regret not going to the show TV on the Radio played here last month.  I supposed it's both good and bad news that finally listening to it didn't make me feel that way, but I also feel like I'm still just getting to know the album.</p>

Here are some other albums that I discovered and subsequently listened to a lot in the last year, despite them having existed for longer that that:
