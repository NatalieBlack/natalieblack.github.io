I made [a small web app called That Silly Nostalgia](http://thatsillynostalgia.herokuapp.com/) for [my beloved Helen](https://twitter.com/thatsillyhelen), who has a healthy appreciation for a trip down social media memory lane, on the occasion of our 11th friendiversary.

For this project I mostly followed the [Google material design guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), which I am currently all about!  I didn't expect to ever feel so fond of a well-placed box shadow.
