A month ago I (uncharacteristically) gave a talk at [Ruby Lightning Talks Toronto](http://www.meetup.com/ruby-lightning-to/) about generative art and Processing*.

The slides from my talk can be seen [here]({{root_url}}/generative_art_lightning_talk). Beware slide 13 (the slide that is 5 spaces to the right on the top level) if you're sensitive to rapidly flashing colours or shapes!

<sub>*If you're wondering what that topic has to do with Ruby, the answer is it doesn't really.  Oops!</sub>
